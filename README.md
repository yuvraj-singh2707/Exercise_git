## Key Features

- Collaborative Git workflow with branching.
- Frontend: HTML code to print a welcome message on screen.
- Backend: Python code to greet user with a name.
- Proper branch management and merging strategy.
- Step-by-step commit history with detailed messages.

## Branch Structure

- `main` – Main production branch.
- `dev/Team-YSP` – Backend and Frontend development branch.

---

## Development Flow

1. Forked repository from main repository.
2. Cloned repository locally using VS Code.
3. Created development branch: `dev/Team-YSP`.
4. Developed frontend and backend modules in parallel.
5. Pushed changes step-by-step using Git commands.
6. Submitted Pull Request for review and merged mutually.
7. Final integration into main branch after review.
